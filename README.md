Description: 

* this project is from https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css The Odin Project
* this is purely an exercise in creating a simple website that looks good. This is not about creating an interactive web page

What I learned: 

* Spending 20 minutes to understand Chrome dev tools is well worth the 20 mins... 
* How to inspect someone else's web page with Chrome tools and understand the exact styling that is used on that page
* That I should not skip over challenges in a learning programme - that completing 'simple' challenges is worth the time and effort to help me get proficient at building web pages
* Even the most simple looking web pages have a lot of things going visual elements going on when you pay close attention
* How to manage Github across multiple computers
